- The server list is in a format readable and writable by common/config.c
- Each server is stored as a section
    - The section is given the name the user inputs when creating the entry
    - The section contains the following vars
        - addresses: A comma-separated list of the addresses the server can be reached from
            - Addresses can be IPv4 addresses or domain names
            - A port can be specified by adding a colon and then the port number (the default port is 46000)
        - uid: The UID used to log in to the server
            - Should be empty if no UID has been provided by the server or user

Example:

[My Server]
address = 127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1:46000,localhost,localhost:46000
uid = 000000000000001C

[I'll join later]
address = later.time
uid = 

[Foobar Network]
address = foo.bar,foobar.ddns.net
uid = 0000000000000042

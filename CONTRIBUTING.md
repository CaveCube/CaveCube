### CONTRIBUTING GUIDE
- Please fork the `dev` branch and not the `master` branch
    - The `master` branch is reserved for working releases and is only updated when the version is incremented
- Please use the coding style/format represented in the rest of the code
- Don't contribute mallicious code
- Try not to pull in more external dependencies unless they can be statically linked
    - The less the amount of library binaries that need to be included, the better
- Try not to use/add large or bloated dependencies
    - Most of the time it's not really needed, and the functionality can probably be implemented locally with a bit of work
    - It will almost certainly hurt performance
    - It will increase project download size
- Do not use any other languages besides C (no ++, no #) for anything under `src/*/`
